# Foundry Zero Open Source Project Contributing Guide

üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç


The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to LLEF which is hosted in the Foundry Zero organisation on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct
This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to info@foundryzero.co.uk.

## What should I know before I get started?

Take a look at the [README.md](https://github.com/foundryzero/llef/blob/main/README.md) for more information about LLEF.
 
## How Can I Contribute?

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to LLEF? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues](https://github.com/foundryzero/llef/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/foundryzero/llef/labels/help-wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

#### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain LLEF's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible LLEF

Please follow the [styleguides](https://github.com/foundryzero/llef/blob/main/.CONTRIBUTING/PYTHON%20STYLE.md)

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
