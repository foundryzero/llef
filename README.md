# LLEF

LLEF (pronounced ɬɛf - "hlyeff") is an LLDB plugin to make it more usable for low-level RE and VR. Similar to [GEF](https://github.com/hugsy/gef), but for LLDB.

It uses LLDB's Python API to add extra status output and a few new commands, so that security researchers can more easily use LLDB to analyse software as it's running.

## 💻 Supported Architectures
* x86_64
* arm
* aarch64 / arm64

## 📓 Requirements
* LLDB 15+ (https://apt.llvm.org/) _On macOS this is bundled with Xcode 14.3+_

## ⚙ Installation
The instructions below will install LLEF so that it is used by LLDB by default.

1. Clone the repository.
2. `cd <repo>`
3. Run `./install.sh`
4. Select automatic (overwrites `~/.lldbinit`) or manual installation.

_LLDB uses AT&T disassembly syntax for x86 binaries by default. The installer provides an option to override this._

## ▶ Usage

### Launch LLDB

```bash
lldb-15 <optional binary to debug>
```

### Use commands:
#### Pattern Create
```
(lldb) pattern create 10
[+] Generating a pattern of 10 bytes (n=4)
aaaabaaaca
[+] Pattern saved in variable: $8
(lldb) pattern create 100 -n 2
[+] Generating a pattern of 100 bytes (n=2)
aabacadaea
[+] Pattern saved in variable: $9
```

#### Pattern Search

```
(lldb) pattern search $rdx
[+] Found in $10 at index 45 (big endian)
(lldb) pattern search $8
[+] Found in $10 at index 0 (little endian)
(lldb) pattern search aaaabaaac
[+] Found in $8 at index 0 (little endian)
(lldb) pattern search 0x61616161626161616361
[+] Found in $8 at index 0 (little endian)
```


### Breakpoint hook
This is automatic and prints all the currently implemented information at a break point.

## 👷‍♂️ Troubleshooting LLDB Python support
LLDB comes bundled with python modules that are required for LLEF to run. If on launching LLDB with LLEF you encounter `ModuleNotFoundError` messages it is likely you will need to manually add the LLDB python modules on your python path.

To do this run the following to establish your site-packages location:

```bash
python3 -m site --user-site
```

Then locate the LLDB python modules location. This is typically at a location such as `/usr/lib/llvm-15/lib/python3.10/dist-packages` but depends on your python version.

Finally, modify and execute the following to add the above LLDB module path into a new file `lldb.pth` in the site-packages location discovered above.

```bash
echo "/usr/lib/llvm-15/lib/python3.10/dist-packages" > ~/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/lldb.pth
```

## 👏 Thanks
We’re obviously standing on the shoulders of giants here - we’d like to credit [hugsy](https://twitter.com/_hugsy_) for [GEF](https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in particular, from which this tool draws *heavy* inspiration! Please consider this imitation as flattery 🙂
